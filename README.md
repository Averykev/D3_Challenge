# D3_Challenge

Data Journalism and D3:

1.)  This project uses D3 in order to create a data visualization that has three different x-axis variables and three different y-axis variables that are 
selectable.  There are 9 different combinations of potential visualizations.

2.)  I created several functions to render the x & y axes, render the circles and the text inside the circles, and the tool tip for when you hover over the circles.

3.)  I created a group to identify which label is selected on either axis and then assign the data accordingly.

4.)  I read in the data and then ultimately created an event listener to see which axis label is clicked.  Once one of the labels is clicked it runs the functions
that I created and updates the chart.

Thank you for looking at my visualization!
